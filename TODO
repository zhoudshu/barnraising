Traces:
 - convert access.log to usable trace + server dir

Latency/throughput harness:
 - run tests with keep-alive
 - run tests with proxy, client, and server on different machines
   - run with machines spread over internet (low priority)
 - handle traces
 - use -C switch to avoid timestamp truncation
 - periodically record CPU stats
 - redesign with master daemons running on each minion
   - less kludgey ordering
   - get rid of dormant perl processes
   - run tests repeatedly if failed
   - eliminate dependence on local filesystem as much as possible (tar?)

Bandwidth harness:
 - run tests with keep-alive
   - do we need to redesign the caching block structure?
 - how do we simulate limited cache size resources?

Https-generate
 - fix connection pools for multiple host:ports (low priority)
